## üìå Featured Projects

### Backend
- **[spring-design-patterns](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/spring-design-patterns)**: A RESTful API built with Java Spring Boot, using an in-memory H2 database, Hibernate as the ORM, Swagger for API documentation, Docker for containerization, and unit testing with JUnit 5 and Mockito. It applies design patterns like Factory and Strategy to solve complex requirements.
- **[jwt-auth](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/jwt-auth)**: A Spring Boot microservice that provides authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It incorporates Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, Lombok, and Mockito.
- **[arq-hexagonal](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/arq-hexagonal)**: Implementation of Hexagonal Architecture, focused on clean code principles and separation of concerns to ensure a scalable and testable backend.
- **[curso-kubernetes](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/curso-kubernetes)**: A complete deployment setup using Spring Boot microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, Spring Cloud, Load Balancer, JWT Security, and Amazon AWS ECS/EKS for cloud orchestration.
- **[node-calendar-backend](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/node-calendar-backend-)**: A RESTful API developed with Node.js and Express to manage calendar events. Includes JWT-based user authentication and MongoDB for data storage.
- **[React-MERN-Backend](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/React-MERN-Backend)**: Backend for a MERN stack application, built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations and integrates with the frontend. 

### Frontend
- **[react-design-patterns](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/react-design-patterns)**: Frontend project developed in React and TypeScript, following modern design patterns and best practices for scalable and maintainable codebases.
- **[react-calendar-frontend](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/react-calendar-frontend)**: A calendar management application built with React. It includes user authentication and full CRUD operations for events, synchronized with a MongoDB backend.
- **[react-firebase-gallery](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/react-firebase-gallery)**: React-based application featuring user authentication with Firebase and Google Sign-In, text entry storage using Firestore, and image upload integration with Cloudinary.
- **[react-gallery-spa](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/react-gallery-spa)**: A single-page application (SPA) built with React for organizing, searching, and visually browsing image collections in an intuitive way.
- **[react-organizador-tareas](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/react-organizador-tareas)**: A customizable task organizer developed in React. Utilizes React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext for state and behavior management.
- **[custom-hooks-collection](https://github.com/xsoto-developer/custom-hooks-collection)**: A curated library of custom React hooks designed to simplify and optimize frontend development across different use cases.
